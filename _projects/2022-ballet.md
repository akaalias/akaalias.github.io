Built using a qualitative analysis approach inspired by Jane Jacob's pivotal book, "The Death and Life of Great American Cities", Algorand Ballet provides a glimpse into a wallet's "personality" based on its track record with other wallets, ASAs, and applications within the ecosystem. Use Algorand Ballet to gain decision support in an unsafe environment and find better questions to ask about both the technical and ecological aspects of the Algorand Blockchain.

Algorand Ballet is more than just a tool for personal safety; it's a tool for ensuring the safety of the entire ecosystem. By providing an additional qualitative window to have "more eyes on the sidewalk", Algorand Ballet contributes to making Algorand a safe place for its inhabitants and visitors alike. Just like the eyes of neighbors, shopkeepers, and even visitors keep a sidewalk safe by simply being there.

Algorand Ballet allows you to build meaningful relationships, witness history, and buy the first Warhols for a penny and a dime, all while ensuring the safety and security of the entire ecosystem.
