Unblah works great with Zoom, Teams, WebEx, Hangouts, and even phone calls, allowing you to stay on track and focused no matter the platform. With its gentle, visible "red-green traffic-light" live notification, you'll be able to keep an eye on how long you've been speaking and adjust your contribution accordingly.

Choose your personal goal, whether it's talking less or talking more, and let Unblah's hands-free, speech-triggered countdown timer guide you. With the live timeline for in-meeting adjustments, you'll always know where you stand and how to adjust your participation to meet your goals.

Unblah keeps track of your "airtime" during calls, allowing you to develop a better sense of timing and improve your meeting skills over time. And because it's self-contained and works without internet, you can take Unblah with you anywhere you go.

The native, bloat-free macOS application is easy to install and use, with setup and installation guides to help you get started quickly. And if you need extra help, the "Get Comfortable" guide provides 15 minutes of tips and tricks to help you make the most of Unblah.

Overall, Unblah is a must-have tool for anyone who struggles with nervousness in meetings and wants to improve their communication skills. Get it today and start taking control of your meetings, achieving your goals, and becoming a more effective communicator!
