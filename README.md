**Dear Friend**, 

It is great to meet you. I'm thrilled you're here.

My name is Alexis, I'm a product manager and software developer. 

To give you a sense, I recently shipped [Unblah](https://unblah.me), [Ballet](https://akaalias.github.io/algorand-ballet/) and [Quickdown](https://getquickdown.com/).

I've also published a lot of my writing and code here:

- [My Digital Garden](https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau)
- [My Code on Github](https://github.com/akaalias)
- [My Videos on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexisRondeau/videos)

I would love to learn more about YOU! 

All you need to do is [book a free office-hours call](https://calendly.com/alexis-rondeau/lets-talk).

Looking forward to meeting you, 

Alexis
